Write me a python script, with minimal dependencies, which generates a png image of a physics inspired, asthetically pleasing, non periodic tiling, where the tiles are colored with the following colors at random:

#b58900
#cb4b16
#dc322f
#d33682
#6c71c4
#268bd2
#2aa198
#859900

- there should be tiles of many different shapes. All tiles should be roughly the same size.
- There should be padding between the tiles, and the margins are colored #002b36.
- The tiling should extend all the way to the boundaries of the image
- Please uniformly darken all the colors, so they are suitable for a desktop background with a dracula themed UI ontop.

the resolution of the image should be large enough that it looks crisp on any monitor.

Please put a nix shell shebang line at the top of the script with all required dependencies.
