Write me a python script, with minimal dependencies, which generates a png image of an asthetically pleasing, non periodic tiling, where the tiles are colored with the following colors at random:

#b58900
#cb4b16
#dc322f
#d33682
#6c71c4
#268bd2
#2aa198
#859900

- there should be tiles of many different shapes. All tiles should be roughly the same size.
- There should be padding between the tiles, and the margins are colored #002b36.
- The tiling should extend all the way to the boundaries of the image

the resolution of the image should be large enough that it looks crisp on any monitor.

Please put a nix shell shebang line at the top of the script with all required dependencies.
